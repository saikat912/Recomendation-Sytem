## **About the Project**
The Movie Recommender System uses metadata from movies to provide personalized recommendations. By analyzing features like genres, keywords, and cast information, the system identifies similar movies and ranks them based on relevance.

This project is ideal for:
- Learning about content-based filtering techniques.
- Exploring feature engineering with movie metadata.
- Building scalable recommendation systems.

---

## **Features**
1. **Content-Based Recommendations**:
   - Suggests movies similar to a given movie based on metadata.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracts and processes genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews for similarity computation.
3. **Scalable Design**:
   - Handles large datasets with thousands of movies efficiently.
4. **Customizable**:
   - Can be extended to include collaborative filtering or hybrid approaches.

---

## **Dataset**
The project uses two datasets:
1. `movies.csv`: Contains metadata such as genres, keywords, budget, revenue, runtime, etc.
2. `credits.csv`: Includes cast and crew information for each movie.

### Dataset Statistics:
- Total Movies: 4,809
- Key Features: `genres`, `keywords`, `overview`, `cast`, `crew`, `popularity`, etc.
- Language Distribution: 93.78% of movies are in English.

## **Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the datasets (`movies.csv` and `credits.csv`) in the root directory.

---

## **Usage**
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred IDE.
2. Run the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data.
3. Use the recommendation function to get movie suggestions:
   ```python
   recommend_movies("Avatar")
   ```

### Example Output:
If you input "Avatar," the system might recommend:
- "Guardians of the Galaxy"
- "Star Wars: The Force Awakens"
- "Interstellar"
